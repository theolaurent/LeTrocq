/- `transfer%` exposes the relatedness witness; its forward map is native function transport over the
   registered `Nat ≃ Unary` base — and it COMPUTES: -/
example : (transfer% (Nat → Nat)).cov.map (· + 1) Unary.z = Unary.s Unary.z := rfl
example : (transfer% (Nat → Nat)).cov.map (fun n => n + 2) Unary.z = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl
/- the witness relates the two function types by the respectful relation of the base: -/
example : (transfer% (Nat → Nat)).R = RArrow RN.R RN.R := rfl
/- a nested arrow transports too: -/
example : (transfer% (Nat → Nat → Nat)).cov.map (· + ·) Unary.z (Unary.s Unary.z) = Unary.s Unary.z := rfl

/- `trocq` proves a `Unary`-side goal by transferring it to the (easier) `Nat`-side counterpart. -/
example : Unary → Unary := by
  trocq          -- ⊢ Nat → Nat
  exact (· + 1)
example : Unary → Unary → Unary := by
  trocq          -- ⊢ Nat → Nat → Nat
  exact (· + ·)
