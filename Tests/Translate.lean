/- `fun n => n.succ.succ` over `Nat` ⤳ the NATIVE `fun u => u.s.s` over `Unary` (not iso-conjugation). -/
example : (translate% (fun n : Nat => Nat.succ (Nat.succ n))) Unary.z = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl
example : (translate% (fun n : Nat => Nat.succ n)) (Unary.s Unary.z) = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl
/- a constant is translated too: `Nat.zero` ⤳ `Unary.z`. -/
example : (translate% (Nat.succ Nat.zero)) = Unary.s Unary.z := rfl

/- `relate%` exposes the RELATEDNESS — the proof that the native term really is the counterpart.
   Here: `(fun n => n.succ)` relates to the native `(fun u => u.s)` under the base relation `RNU`. -/
example : RArrow RNU RNU (fun n : Nat => Nat.succ n) (fun u : Unary => Unary.s u) :=
  relate% (fun n : Nat => Nat.succ n)

/- Nat NUMERAL leaves: a literal `(2 : Nat)` (an `OfNat.ofNat` numeral) is expanded to its `succ`/`zero`
   normal form and translated to the native `Unary` numeral — and it computes. -/
example : (translate% (2 : Nat)) = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl
/- a numeral nested under a registered primitive translates too. -/
example : (translate% (Nat.succ (1 : Nat))) = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl
/- `relate%` on a numeral gives the relatedness (the native numeral really is its counterpart). -/
example : RNU (2 : Nat) (Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) := relate% (2 : Nat)

/- POLYMORPHISM: the translation handles `Sort`-binders, so a polymorphic term translates structurally.
   `fun (A : Type) (a : A) => a` ⤳ the native polymorphic identity (its action on `Unary` computes). -/
example : (translate% (fun (A : Type) (a : A) => a)) Unary (Unary.s Unary.z) = Unary.s Unary.z := rfl
/- and the `const`-applied form transports its argument: `fun (A:Type)(f:A→A)(a:A) => f (f a)`. -/
example :
    (translate% (fun (A : Type) (f : A → A) (a : A) => f (f a))) Unary Unary.s Unary.z
      = Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z) := rfl

/- PARAMETERIZED TYPES: a `List Nat` rebuilds element-by-element as a `List Unary` (the type former `List`
   crosses via `ListR`, the constructors `nil`/`cons` are term primitives, the element numerals expand). -/
example : (translate% ([1, 2] : List Nat)) = [Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)] := rfl
example : (translate% (List.cons (1 : Nat) [])) = [Unary.s Unary.z] := rfl
example : (translate% ([] : List Nat)) = ([] : List Unary) := rfl
/- a function over lists transports: `List.cons` applied under a λ rebuilds over `Unary`. -/
example : (translate% (fun n : Nat => [n, Nat.succ n])) (Unary.s Unary.z)
    = [Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)] := rfl
/- `relate%` gives the relatedness: the native list really is the `ListR`-counterpart (an inductive proof,
   `ListR.cons` of the element relatednesses). -/
example : ListR Nat Unary RNU [1, 2] [Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)] :=
  relate% ([1, 2] : List Nat)
/- `Option` transports the same way. -/
example : (translate% (some (2 : Nat))) = some (Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) := rfl
example : (translate% (none : Option Nat)) = (none : Option Unary) := rfl

/- DEPENDENT parameterized types. `Sigma` (the dependent pair): `⟨1, 2⟩ : Σ _ : Nat, Nat` rebuilds as a pair
   over `Unary` — the type family `fun _ => Nat` is itself transported (to `fun _ => Unary`) and the two
   components cross as terms. -/
example : (translate% (⟨1, 2⟩ : Σ _ : Nat, Nat))
    = (⟨Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)⟩ : Σ _ : Unary, Unary) := rfl
/- `relate%` gives the `SigmaR` witness (the family relation `RB` is what `param` derived for `fun _ => Nat`).-/
example : SigmaR Nat Unary RNU (fun _ => Nat) (fun _ => Unary) (fun _ _ _ => RNU)
    ⟨1, 2⟩ ⟨Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)⟩ := relate% (⟨1, 2⟩ : Σ _ : Nat, Nat)

/- W-type: a closed tree needs an empty child type (none is registered over `Nat ≃ Unary`), but the driver
   still crosses `WTree.mk` and the dependent family in BOTH type-former position (the binder `f`'s type) and
   constructor position — exercised here by transporting a closed λ that builds a node. -/
example : (translate% (fun (a : Nat) (f : Nat → WTree Nat (fun _ => Nat)) => @WTree.mk Nat (fun _ => Nat) a f))
    = (fun (a : Unary) (f : Unary → WTree Unary (fun _ => Unary)) => @WTree.mk Unary (fun _ => Unary) a f) := rfl

/- PROP-RELATION REFINEMENT: a `Prop`-valued component now relates by LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE `↔` (matching the
   `Prop` universe / `paramProp`), not the old generic proof-relevant `· → · → Type`. A registered predicate
   `p ↦ p'` supplies its own equivalence, and `translate%` rebuilds it over `Unary`. -/
def IsTrivN (_ : Nat)   : Prop := True
def IsTrivU (_ : Unary) : Prop := True
@[trocq] def IsTrivR (n : Nat) (u : Unary) (_ : RNU n u) : PLift (IsTrivN n ↔ IsTrivU u) := PLift.up Iff.rfl

example : (translate% (fun n : Nat => IsTrivN n)) = (fun u : Unary => IsTrivU u) := rfl
/- the relatedness is `PLift (· ↔ ·)` — the refinement (previously `· → · → Type`). -/
example : ∀ (n : Nat) (u : Unary), RNU n u → PLift (IsTrivN n ↔ IsTrivU u) :=
  relate% (fun n : Nat => IsTrivN n)
/- connectives compose congruently: `p n ∧ p n` transports via `and_congr`. -/
example : (translate% (fun n : Nat => IsTrivN n ∧ IsTrivN n))
    = (fun u : Unary => IsTrivU u ∧ IsTrivU u) := rfl

/- QUOTIENTS: `Quot {α} (r : α → α → Prop)` is a former over a type AND a relation `r` (a term arg, whose
   relatedness is the `↔` from the prop refinement). `Quot.mk r a` rebuilds as `Quot.mk r' a'` over `Unary`. -/
example : (translate% (Quot.mk (fun _ _ : Nat => True) (2 : Nat)))
    = Quot.mk (fun _ _ : Unary => True) (Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) := rfl

/- CARTESIAN PRODUCT: `(1, 2) : Nat × Nat` rebuilds COMPONENTWISE over `Unary` (the two type parameters
   each cross as a triple; `Prod.mk` is the term primitive). -/
example : (translate% ((1, 2) : Nat × Nat)) = (Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) := rfl
example : ProdR Nat Unary RNU Nat Unary RNU (1, 2) (Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) :=
  relate% ((1, 2) : Nat × Nat)

/- NON-DEPENDENT SUM: each injection crosses carrying its payload (the OTHER summand's type crosses too,
   as the unused triple). -/
example : (translate% (Sum.inl 1 : Nat ⊕ Nat)) = (Sum.inl (Unary.s Unary.z) : Unary ⊕ Unary) := rfl
example : (translate% (Sum.inr 2 : Nat ⊕ Nat))
    = (Sum.inr (Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)) : Unary ⊕ Unary) := rfl
example : SumR Nat Unary RNU Nat Unary RNU (Sum.inl 1) (Sum.inl (Unary.s Unary.z)) :=
  relate% (Sum.inl 1 : Nat ⊕ Nat)

/- ARRAY: an array literal `#[…]` elaborates to `List.toArray […]`, so the translation crosses it through
   the `List.toArray` term primitive — rebuilding element-by-element as the underlying list does. -/
example : (translate% (#[1, 2] : Array Nat)) = #[Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)] := rfl
example : (translate% (#[] : Array Nat)) = (#[] : Array Unary) := rfl
example : ArrayR Nat Unary RNU #[1, 2] #[Unary.s Unary.z, Unary.s (Unary.s Unary.z)] :=
  relate% (#[1, 2] : Array Nat)

/- BOOL is registered DIAGONALLY (no other equivalence for it is in scope), so a bool crosses to ITSELF and
   its relatedness is the diagonal `BoolR` — exercising a ground inductive with nullary constructors. -/
example : (translate% (fun b : Bool => b)) = (fun b : Bool => b) := rfl
example : (translate% (true, false)) = (true, false) := rfl
example : BoolR true true := relate% true
