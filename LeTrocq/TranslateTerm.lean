The TERM TRANSLATION `⟨·⟩` (DESIGN.md's simple term translation).

For a term/type `e` it produces ONLY the B-side counterpart `[e]` (`e` rebuilt leaf-by-leaf over `B` — NOT
`iso ∘ e ∘ iso⁻¹`). It recurses structurally (`.const`, `.fvar`, `.app`, `.lam`, `∀`, sort, `Nat` numerals)
and bottoms out at registered PRIMITIVES; an unregistered head is an ERROR — the translation never unfolds a
definition.

  ⟨c⟩        = registered counterpart (term primitive / type former / Prop predicate; else error)
  ⟨x⟩        = x'                                       (bound variable's counterpart)
  ⟨f a⟩      = ⟨f⟩ ⟨a⟩
  ⟨fun x=>b⟩ = fun x'=>⟨b⟩
  ⟨Πx:A. B⟩  = Πx':⟨A⟩. ⟨B⟩

This is HALF of the twofold translation: the RELATEDNESS `[e] : 〚T〛 e ⟨e⟩` is the graded relational
translation `[·]` in `LeTrocq.Transfer`, which is the sole consumer of `⟨·⟩` (`[t u] = [t] u ⟨u⟩ [u]`).
`translate% e` elaborates to `⟨e⟩`; the shared `Ctx`/`buildCtx`/`sym*` below serve both `⟨·⟩` and `[·]`.

/-- the `⟨·⟩` registration (COUNTERPARTS only): type formers/bases/relators ↦ B-side head; term primitives ↦
    (B-term, relatedness witness). The second component of `terms` (the relatedness) is what `[·]` reads; `⟨·⟩`
    uses only the first. A `Prop`'s counterpart comes from its RELATOR entry in `types` (`And ↦ And`,
    `Pos ↦ Pos'`); its relatedness is the graded `Param` witness `[·]` builds. -/

/-- `⟨·⟩` — THE TERM TRANSLATION (DESIGN.md's `⟨·⟩`): rebuild `e`'s B-side counterpart leaf by leaf. A
    registered head maps to its counterpart (a term primitive `Nat.succ ↦ Unary.s`, a type former
    `List ↦ List`, or a `Prop` predicate `p ↦ p'`); a bound variable to its counterpart `x'`; a Π/λ/app/sort
    structurally; a `Nat` numeral through its `succ`/`zero` normal form. An unregistered head is an ERROR —
    the translation never unfolds. This produces ONLY the counterpart; the relatedness is the graded `[·]`
    in `LeTrocq.Transfer`, which calls back here for every counterpart it needs (`[t u] = [t] u ⟨u⟩ [u]`). -/

    (binders in triples); this returns `fun a' a aR … => cWit a a' aR …`. Its relatedness binder keeps the
    type `R a a'`, which is *defeq* to the symmetric relation `R.sym a' a` the backward direction supplies —
    so the same proof term serves both directions, only the value arguments swap position. -/
